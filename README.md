Google-Analytics-Wordpress-Plugin
=================================

What's this?
===========
This is a plugin I built to simplify and show in a Wordpress dashboard simplified and accessible analytics metrics.

How do I use this?
=================
You'll need a Client_ID from the Google Developer's console, and you can enter it in the settings page of the app.
Your Client_ID should be associated with the account you plan on using with your Google Analytics Account.
I'm working on making this more accessible, by writing the app using a Google service account, but because I wrote this mostly in client-side Javascript, this is proving difficult.
This is my first plugin and I'd love any help improving it. Submit any changes you'd like and email me at mcgourty.alex@autodesk.com.
